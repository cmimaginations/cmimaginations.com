Best parts of each design:

portfolio
    homepage
    parallax color effect
    orkney font

coaching
    side-scrolling tiles
    cleaner tiles

scrolling options:
    option 1: tile slides from left to right off-screen. once tile A is on the right side, tile B slides in from the bottom.

    option 2: tile A slides from left, to even more left offscreen. tile B immediately begins sliding up from the bottom on the opposite side.
